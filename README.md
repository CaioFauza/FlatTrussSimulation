# FlatTrussSimulation
## Software for Simulation of Flat Trusses in python

This software was developed for a subject called heat transfers and solids mechanics, from the computer engineering course at Insper. The main idea was to input the characteristics of a structure such as a bridge, using a table and to generate support reactions, nodal displacements, deformations, internal forces and internal stresses as an output using the finite element method.

The file "funcoesTermosol.py" was provided by the teachers of the discipline, with functions in Portuguese to assist in receiving the information and generating the output graph.
The file "contest.py" contains the structure to be analyzed, which can be viewed below:

The file "flatTrussSimulator.py" is used to run the software itself. You will need to select the method available for solving the system of differential equations (Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi) using an input and after that, you will have the results generated by the algorithm.

O resultado para a estrutura "context.xlsx" Ã© gravado no arquivo "output.txt" e pode ser visualizado abaixo:
